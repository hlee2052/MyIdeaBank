###Features:
You can add different ideas into the main list. When you click an idea, it will be expanded into a new screen where there are 
buttons to do other actions. For each idea, you can delete, like or hate the idea and your net like is
shown as a number. Also, the moment you press a like or hate button, the time is recorded as list and you can keep track of the
dates of when you either liked or hated your idea. 

In addition, for each idea, you can view the lat/lon and it returns a map of where it was created. Also, it uses Google reverse 
geocoding API to fetch lat/lon and give information on where the idea was created.
